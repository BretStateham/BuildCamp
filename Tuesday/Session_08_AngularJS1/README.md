# Intro to AngularJS#
==========

## Overview ##

In the previous session we used Bootstrap to layout the basic UI for our bartNow web site.  In this session, we'll learn how to use AngularJS to start showing data on the site.   

[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) is a web application development framework created by Google. It uses the **"Model-View-Controller"** (**MVC**) pattern to help web developers create client side apps (meaning they run in the browser) that are more maintainable and testable.  Although in the interest of making these demos fit in the allotted time, we won't be getting into testing the apps.  

> **Note:** At the time this is being written, AngularJS is at **version 1.2.19**.  The steps we take in this lab assume that version.  The Angular source files are included with the lab so you should be able to follow along using the provided files even if the official version of bootstrap has revved. 

## Objectives ##

At the end of this session, you should be able to 

- Add AngularJS to your own website
- Understand the basics of AngularJS apps
- Create an AngularJS Models, Views and Controllers

## Setup ##

The files you need to get started are included in the directory structure along with this file.  However, it is assumed that:

- You have **Visual Studio 2013** 
- You have the files included with this session:
	- The **"/Assets"** directory contains the various libraries and additional files you will add to the website you build in this session.
	- The **/AngularJS1BeginSollution"** directory contains the completed site from the previous Bootstrap session. If you had a problem with your site from the previous session, you can use this folder as a starting point.  
	- The **"/AngularJS1EndSolution"** directory contains the completed site for this session.  You can use this as a reference.  

## Exercises ##

## Add AngularJS to the Site ##

1. You can download AngularJS for free from http://angularjs.org.  Click on the download button near the middle of the page:

1. Then in the **"Download AngularJS"** popup, you can select the version and format you wish to download.  We'll use the current 1.2.19 release version, and grab it as a .zip file so we get all of the available AngularJS modules.  

	![01-020-DownloadAngularJS](images/01-020-downloadangularjs.png?raw=true "Download AngularJS")

1. Again, though, just to ensure that we are all working off the same version, the AngularJS 1.2.19 files that are needed for this session have already been included in the **"/Assets/AngularJS"** folder.  

1. Let's start out by opening the solution from the previous session.  If you completed the Bootstrap into lab successfully, and your markup matches the end result, you can continue working with it.  Otherwise, open the
